			<h2>Armenia</h2>
			<p class="paragraphs">
				<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armenia">Armenia</a>,landlocked country of Transcaucasia, lying just south of the great mountain range of the Caucasus and fronting the northwestern extremity of Asia. To the north and east Armenia is bounded by Georgia and Azerbaijan, while its neighbours to the southeast and west are, respectively, Iran and Turkey. Naxçıvan, an exclave of Azerbaijan, borders Armenia to the southwest. The capital is Yerevan (Erevan).
				Modern Armenia comprises only a small portion of ancient Armenia, one of the world’s oldest centres of civilization. At its height, Armenia extended from the south-central Black Sea coast to the Caspian Sea and from the Mediterranean Sea to Lake Urmia in present-day Iran. Ancient Armenia was subjected to constant foreign incursions, finally losing its autonomy in the 14th century ce. The centuries-long rule of Ottoman and Persian conquerors imperiled the very existence of the Armenian people. Eastern Armenia was annexed by Russia during the 19th century, while western Armenia remained under Ottoman rule, and in 1894–96 and 1915 the Ottoman government perpetrated systematic massacres and forced deportations of Armenians.

			<h2>Armavir</h2>
			<p class="paragraphs">
				Armavir is the capital of the Marz (state) of the same name, though it is probably still called more frequently by its old communist name of Hoktemberyan (in honor of the October Revolution) than by Armavir, the ancient Armenian capital whose ruins are nearby.
				Vans (called marshutni) depart from Yerevan to Armavir regularly throughout the day. Taxis in Yerevan are usually happy to take you there for 100 dram per km. Along the highway from Armavir to Yerevan you can catch vans and buses heading to Yerevan, or even private cars, but if you are west of Armavir your options are more limited, as there is much less traffic.
				Day tours from Yerevan are offered by some companies by van with other tourists, including guide and sometimes lunch which include the most popular destination of the area - Sardarapat.
